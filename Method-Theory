Que.1)Write a method that returns the square of a number.
Answer- Class Square
	{
		public static void main(String[]args)
		{
			int num=3;
			System.out.println(Square(num));
		}
		public static int Square(int num)
		{
			return num*num;
		}
	}

Que.2)What is the difference between a static method and a non-static method?
Answer- ------------------static Method-----------------
 	1)The Method Which is Prefix with static keyword is called static method.
	2)We can Write Static method in class block area.
	3)Static method loads at Class loading process.
	4)Static method we called in current class using method signature.
	5)we call static class in another class using classname and method Signature.
	6)Cannot access instance(object) variables directly.
	7)example- public static void methodName (Formal Arguments)
	------------------Non-Static Method-----------------
	1)Method belongs to object (instance of class).
	2)We write non-static method in class block area.
	3)Method wich is not prefix with any modifiers.
	4)Non static method called only through the object.
	5)Memory location or loads at Object Creation time.
	6)can access both static variables and instance of variable.
	7)example-public void methodName (Formal Arguments).

Que.3)Create a method that takes two integers and returns their maximum.
Answer- class Max
	{
		public static void main(String[]args)
		{
			int a=10,b=20;
			Syatem.out.println(maxNum(a,b));
		}
		public static int maxNum(int a,int b)
		{
			return a>b ? a : b;
		}
	}

Que.4)What does the void return type mean in Java?
Answer- 1)Used with keyword void.
	2)No value need to be returned.
	3)We used return; to exit the method early.
	4)we cannot used return val/exp; its throws compile time error.
	5)Used Print data,Update value,display UI,Logging etc.

Que.5)Write a method called isEven(int num) that returns true if the number is even.
Answer- class EvenOrOdd
	{
		public static void main(String[]args)
		{ 
			int num;
			System.out.println(isEven(num));
		}
		public static boolean isEven(int num)
		{
			if(num%2==0)
				return true;
			return false;
		}
	}

Que.6)What happens if a method is defined with a return type but doesn't return anything?
Answer- Compiler Throws Comple time error Missing return Statement.

Que.7)Can methods in Java be overloaded? Give an example.
Answer- YES..!
	Method with same name but different parameter list or different datatypes its called 
	Method Overloading.

QUE.8)What is method overloading vs method overriding?
Answer- ------------------Method Overloading------------------
	1)Same Method name but different parameters.
	2)Belongs to same class
	3)To perform similar task to different inputs.
	4)return type can be same or different.
	5)Compile time Polymorphism.
	6)Inheritance not required.
	-----------------Method Overriding--------------------
	1)Same method name and parameter in child class.
	2)Different class i.e.Inheritance.
	3)To perform specific implementation in child.
	4)Return type must be same or covarient.
	5)Run-Time Polymorphism.
	6)Inheritance required parent-child Relationship.
